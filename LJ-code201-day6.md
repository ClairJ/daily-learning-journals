##LJ Code201-Day6
Sept 25, 2017

Progress was a lot slower today, it took a lot longer than expected to figure out how to put all the pieces together for the first part of this lab. Right now my code works but its literally so scraped together it looks horrifyingly ugly to say the least. I think I am grasping the concepts it is just taking a little longer than normal.
