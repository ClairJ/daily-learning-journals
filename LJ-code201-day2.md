<h2>#LJ Code 201- Day2</h2>
Today brought to my attend a few key aspects that I didn't realize about css and js. I made mistakes left and right from using the variables twice in different if statements. I used what I knew about HTML and CSS to anchor my pages together so that the page was fluid and the java was active on a button click.
Today was an overall good experience where I didn't feel overwhelmed or falling behind and I was able to help others around me for the day while I was ahead.
