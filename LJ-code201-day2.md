## LJ Code 201- Day2
Sept19-2017


Today brought to my attend a few key aspects that I didn't realize about css and js. I made mistakes left and right from using the variables twice in different if statements. I used what I knew about HTML and CSS to anchor my pages together so that the page was fluid and the java was active on a button click.
Today was an overall good experience where I didn't feel overwhelmed or falling behind and I was able to help others around me for the day while I was ahead.

## LJ Code 201- Day4
Sept21-2017


Today was pretty relaxing after the mind melting from the day before. Arrays made things so much simpler without having to have this long page of code. I no longer feel overwhelmed and ready for the next class. I didn't have any broken code and I feel it's worth while being able to get ahead for the next day.
