## 8th Learning Journal

I have been able to catch up on my redux labs 31-33 and got a headstart on the binary tree lab which put me into a good spot going into this week. This week has been ridiculously overwhelming, not only for myself but most of the class which makes me feel a little bit better. The labs are unclear on what to do, material is getting added at night, this week just feels like a disorganized mess.
